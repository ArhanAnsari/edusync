# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide - EduSync Fixes

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install resend
```

## Step 2: Environment Variables

Create or update `.env.local` in the root directory:

```env
# Resend API Key for Email Functionality
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Get your key from: https://resend.com/api-keys
# Free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000 emails/month
```

## Step 3: Add Service Worker to Layout

Open `app/layout.tsx` and add the Service Worker registration:

```typescript
import ServiceWorkerRegistration from '@/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className="dark">
      <body>
        <ServiceWorkerRegistration />
        {/* ...rest of your layout... */}
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Update Appwrite (If Not Done Already)

In Appwrite Console, add these optional attributes to the `submissions` collection:
- `userName` (String, 255 chars, Optional)
- `userEmail` (String, 255 chars, Optional)

This fixes the "Unknown User" display issue.

## Step 5: Test Everything

### Test Quiz Attempts Fix
```bash
# Login as different students and attempt the same quiz
# Each student should have separate attempt counters
```

### Test Live Chat
```bash
# Click the chat icon (bottom-right corner, moved to avoid Sentry button)
# Type messages like "help", "quiz", "login" to see smart responses
```

### Test Newsletter
```bash
# Enter an email in the footer
# Check:
# 1. Subscriber receives welcome email
# 2. You receive admin notification at arhanansari2009@gmail.com
```

### Test Offline Mode
```bash
# Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
# Application tab â†’ Service Workers â†’ Check "Offline"
# Navigate around - pages should still load from cache
# Attempt a quiz - should queue for sync
# Uncheck "Offline" - should auto-sync the queued attempt
```

## Step 6: Verify Dark Theme

```bash
# Navigate to /dashboard/teacher/quizzes
# Click "Create Quiz" button
# Form should have dark background (not white)
```

## Step 7: Check Button Positions

```bash
# Go to any page
# Bottom-right corner should show:
# - Live Chat button (further left)
# - Sentry "Report a Bug" button (right corner)
# Both should be visible and not overlapping
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering
1. Check console for errors
2. Make sure `public/sw.js` exists
3. Service Workers only work on `localhost` or `https://` domains
4. Clear cache: DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Clear Storage

### Newsletter Emails Not Sending
1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is in `.env.local`
2. Restart dev server after adding env vars
3. Check Resend dashboard for email logs
4. Verify "from" domain is verified in Resend (or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing)

### Quiz Attempts Still Global
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Verify the code change in `app/dashboard/student/quizzes/page.tsx` line ~107
3. Check that Appwrite has the Query import working

### Offline Not Working
1. Check if Service Worker is registered: `chrome://serviceworker-internals/`
2. Verify IndexedDB: DevTools â†’ Application â†’ IndexedDB
3. Make sure you're testing on `localhost` or `https://`
