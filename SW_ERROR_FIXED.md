## What We Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Disabled SW in Development
Service Worker now only runs in production mode, not in development with Turbopack.

**File**: `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx`
- Added check: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`
- Development mode: SW skipped (no conflicts)
- Production mode: SW works normally

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Offline URL
Changed `/offline` ‚Üí `/offline.html` to match actual file.

**File**: `public/sw.js`
- Fixed OFFLINE_URL path
- Reduced PRECACHE_ASSETS to essential files only
- Removed non-existent paths

### 3. ‚úÖ Created Cleanup Tool
Interactive page to manually clean up problematic service workers.

**File**: `public/sw-cleanup.html`
- Unregister service workers
- Clear all caches
- Clear local storage
- Check status
