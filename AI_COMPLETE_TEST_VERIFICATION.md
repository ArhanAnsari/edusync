## 🐛 Bug Fixed

### Error: "body stream already read"

**Issue:**
```
TypeError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': body stream already read
```

**Root Cause:**
- Response body was being read twice
- First: `await response.json()` in error handling
- Second: `response.body?.getReader()` for streaming

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Use `response.clone().json()` for error handling
2. ✅ Check response.ok BEFORE reading body
3. ✅ Read EITHER json OR stream, never both
4. ✅ Add proper stream error handling

**File Modified:**
- `components/AISmartAssistant.tsx` (Lines 195-267)
