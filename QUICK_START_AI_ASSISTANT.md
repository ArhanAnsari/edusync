## 🎯 Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: "Explain photosynthesis" works better than "help"
2. **Use Quick Actions**: Click buttons for instant common tasks
3. **Follow Up**: Ask follow-up questions for deeper understanding
4. **Set Your Role**: Set localStorage role for personalized experience

### Example Conversation

```
You: "Help me understand Newton's first law"

AI: "Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at 
     rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same 
     speed and direction unless acted upon by an external force..."

You: "Can you give me a real-world example?"

AI: "Of course! Think about when you're in a car that suddenly 
     brakes. Your body continues moving forward because of inertia. 
     That's why seatbelts are so important!..."
```
