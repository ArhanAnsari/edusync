## 💡 Tips

1. **Clear Cache**: If theme toggle isn't working, try:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear "Cookies and site data"
   - Refresh the page

2. **Check Local Storage**: 
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Check Local Storage → http://localhost:3000
   - Look for `theme` key

3. **Test in Incognito**: 
   - Open incognito window
   - No cached data
   - Fresh test of theme persistence

4. **Multiple Browsers**: Test in:
   - Chrome/Edge
   - Firefox
   - Safari (if on Mac)

---

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

If you still see errors:

1. **Stop the server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Clear Next.js cache**:
   ```bash
   rmdir /s /q .next
   ```
3. **Restart**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check files were saved**:
   - app/layout.tsx (should import Providers)
   - app/error.tsx (no html/body wrapper)
   - app/signup/page.tsx (has GitHub button)
