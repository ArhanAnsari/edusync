## If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "AI service not configured"
```
✓ Check: .env.local has GEMINI_API_KEY
✓ Restart: npm run dev
✓ Check: Key is valid and not expired
```

### Error: "Rate limited"
```
✓ Wait: 5-10 minutes
✓ Try: Simpler request
✓ Check: API quota at Google Cloud
```

### Error: "Timeout"
```
✓ Check: Internet connection
✓ Try: Shorter prompt
✓ Wait: Retry in a moment
```

### Error: Empty response
```
✓ Try: More specific prompt
✓ Check: API key is valid
✓ Verify: Model is accessible
```

## Environment Setup

Your `.env.local` should have:
```
