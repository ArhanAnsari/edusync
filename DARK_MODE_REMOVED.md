## Components That Can Be Deleted

The following theme-related files are **no longer used** and can be safely deleted:

### Backgrounds
- Main: `bg-gray-900`
- Secondary: `bg-gray-800`
- Gradient: `from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900`

### Text
- Primary: `text-gray-100` (white)
- Secondary: `text-gray-300`
- Muted: `text-gray-400`

### Borders
- `border-gray-700`

### Accents
- Blue: `text-blue-400`, `bg-blue-900`
- Indigo: Used in gradients
- Purple: Used in hero gradients

### Interactive States
- Hover: `hover:text-blue-400`, `hover:text-blue-500`

## Result

✅ **All pages now have a consistent dark theme**

✅ **Fixed, beautiful dark design throughout**

The website is now simpler, faster, and has a consistent dark aesthetic across all pages!
