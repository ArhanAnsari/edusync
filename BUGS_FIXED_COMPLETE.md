# ðŸŽ‰ ALL BUGS FIXED - EduSync Update Summary

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### 1. **CRITICAL: Quiz Attempts Bug** âœ…
**Problem:** Quiz attempts were counting globally for all students instead of per-student.
**Fix:** Added `Query.equal('userId', user.$id)` filter in `fetchAttempts()` function.
**Location:** `app/dashboard/student/quizzes/page.tsx` line 107-115
**Impact:** Each student now has their own attempt counter that works correctly.

### 2. **White Background on Teacher Quizzes** âœ…
**Problem:** Quiz creation form had white background instead of dark theme.
**Fix:** Changed Card to `bg-gray-800 border-gray-700` and all inputs to dark theme.
**Location:** `app/dashboard/teacher/quizzes/page.tsx` lines 192-238
**Impact:** Consistent dark theme across entire teacher dashboard.

### 3. **Live Chat Positioning Conflict** âœ…
**Problem:** Live chat button was hidden behind Sentry's "Report a Bug" button.
**Fix:** Changed z-index from `z-50` to `z-40` and moved position from `right-6` to `right-24`.
**Location:** `components/LiveChat.tsx` lines 76-84
**Impact:** Both buttons now visible and accessible.

### 4. **Live Chat Not Working** âœ…
**Problem:** Chat only simulated responses, wasn't functional.
**Fix:** Created `/api/chat` endpoint with smart auto-responses + integrated real API calls.
**New Files:** 
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Backend chat API
- Updated `components/LiveChat.tsx` - Frontend integration with fetch API
**Features:**
- Smart keyword detection (help, quiz, login, etc.)
- Session management
- Auto-scroll to latest message

### 5. **Newsletter with Resend** âœ…

```
**Install:** Run `npm install resend`

### 6. **Offline Functionality** âœ…

**New Files:**
- `public/sw.js` - Service Worker with caching strategy
- `public/offline.html` - Beautiful offline fallback page
- `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` - SW registration component

**Features:**
