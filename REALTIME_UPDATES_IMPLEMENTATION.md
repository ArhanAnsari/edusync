   (student.email?.toLowerCase() || '').includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
   (student.phone || '').includes(searchTerm)
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Subscription Pattern

```typescript
// Watch a collection for changes
const unsubscribe = await databases.watch(
  config.databaseId,
  config.collections.users,
  (response: any) => {
    if (response.events && response.events.length > 0) {
      fetchStats(); // Refetch data on change
    }
  }
);

// Store unsubscribe function for cleanup
return () => {
  if (unsubscribe) {
    unsubscribe();
  }
};
```

### Data Flow

```

Real-time Subscription Triggered
      ↓
Callback Function Executes
      ↓
fetchStats() Called
